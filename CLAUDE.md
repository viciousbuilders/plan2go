# plan2go

## What this is

plan2go is a no-login planner for a multi-day trip, used by a parent organising a
family holiday in a city they have never visited and cannot judge distances in. They
drop stops on a map, see real travel times, reorder until the day actually works, and
hand the result to the people travelling with them as a read-only link or a printed
page. The hard part of this product is the time engine, everything else is typing.

## Non-negotiables

**Identity.** No authentication. A random slug at `/t/[slug]` identifies a trip. An edit
token in an httpOnly cookie authorises mutations. `Trip.userId` is nullable and stays
that way until accounts exist.

**The front door.** `/` is the page in `src/app/(marketing)`: the stops the trip makes,
each a city and how many days in it, and the day it departs. The first city is the trip's
own and sets its time zone. Submitting it opens a trip and lands on `/t/[slug]`.
The button inside a trip that starts another one posts to `/new` instead, and both come
through `openTrip`, so they share one rate limit and one place that hands out the edit
token.

**Stack.** Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Prisma, Tailwind, the Google Maps
JavaScript API, Vitest. Postgres only, never SQLite, deployed to Vercel. Package
manager is pnpm.

**Paid APIs.** Google Places and Google Routes are server side only. Never
`NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Every call goes through our own route handler, is rate limited by IP,
and is cached in our own table keyed by the inputs that determine the answer. Check the
cache before any paid call.

The map is the one exception, and it is a separate key. The Maps JavaScript API
authenticates from the browser, so `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY` is exposed on
purpose and is restricted in the Google Cloud console to that one API and to our own
referrers. It never authorises Places or Routes. `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is the server
key, is read only by `src/server/places/google-key.ts`, and never reaches the browser.
Two keys, and the rule above holds for everything the server pays for.

**The time engine.** `src/core` is pure TypeScript. No React, no Next, no Prisma, no
network, no `Date.now()`. Anything external is an interface in `src/core/ports` with an
implementation in `src/adapters`. Travel times come from Google Routes, wrapped in the
leg cache, composed in `src/app/t/[slug]/travel.ts`. The haversine provider is still
there and still answers everything when there is no key. Neither of them changed the
engine.

There are three ways to travel: driving, public transport and walking. Flying is not one
of them. Nobody sells us flight availability, the Routes API has no such mode, and a
straight line at an assumed speed offered a flight between any two points on earth.
Adding it back means a flight data provider, Amadeus or Duffel or similar, behind the
same port.

Cycling was one and no longer is, for the nearer version of the same reason. The Routes
API returns no cycling route at all across much of the world, so the mode was in practice
answered by a straight line at an assumed speed. Adding it back means a provider that
actually covers it, behind the same port.

`TravelRequest` carries the moment the day sets out on the leg, in minutes since the
epoch, or null while that is not known. A leg's departure depends on the legs before
it, so `legRequestsFor(day, answered)` runs the day through the engine as far as the
answers reach and `computeTrip` asks for the legs one at a time. Public transport is
asked for at that moment, inside the seven days back and hundred ahead that Google
looks up a timetable for, and cached to the quarter hour; a walk takes as long as it
takes, and driving is still asked for without traffic, which is the cheaper tier and
the one whose answer does not move with the moment, so neither is sent one.

**Dependency direction.** `app` to `features` to `server` and `adapters` to `core`.
`core` imports nothing internal. This is enforced by lint, not by good intentions.

**Sharing.** The share artifact is a read-only web page first and a print stylesheet
second. No PDF library: the PDF is that print stylesheet, rendered by a Chromium of our
own on the server (`puppeteer-core` and `@sparticuz/chromium`, in `src/server/pdf`),
so the sheets are written once and the file is the preview.

**Design.** `DESIGN.md` is the source of truth for anything under `src/app/t/`,
`src/features/`, or `src/ui/`, and it overrides the vendored `design-taste-frontend`
skill there. That skill governs the marketing page and the share view only.

## Conventions

Kebab-case filenames everywhere. Tests colocated beside their source as
`thing.test.ts`, never in a mirrored tree. No barrel `index.ts` files. Do not create a
new top-level folder without asking.

A feature folder stays flat until it holds about 20 source files, not counting tests
and CSS, or until `app` starts importing one group of its files on their own. Then
that group moves into a subfolder of the feature, as `day-planner/export/` did, and
not into a sibling feature, because features do not import from each other.

## State of the repo

Postgres is hosted on Neon and there is no local database. Development, the tests and
anything deployed all read the one Neon database, so a schema change or a stray write
lands everywhere at once. Credentials live in `.env`, which the Prisma CLI reads and
Next.js reads as well, so one file serves both. `DATABASE_URL` is the pooled connection
and `DIRECT_URL` is the direct one that schema changes need.

Do not create a local database and do not switch the provider to sqlite. Development
and production run the same dialect.

The schema is pushed rather than migrated. `pnpm db:push` syncs `prisma/schema.prisma`
straight to the database and there is no migrations folder. That is the prototyping
workflow, and its cost is that a change dropping or renaming a column takes the data in
it, with Prisma offering to reset the database rather than carrying anything across.
Anything that has to keep existing rows is a migration, and the first deployment with
real users is the point to baseline one.

## Commands

```
pnpm dev          # next dev
pnpm build        # next build
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint         # eslint, zero warnings tolerated
pnpm test         # vitest run
pnpm test:watch   # vitest
pnpm db:generate  # prisma generate
pnpm db:push      # prisma db push, schema straight to the database
```

## Definition of done

A change is done when `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm test` all pass, new
behaviour in `src/core` has a colocated test, user-facing copy follows the writing
rules, and nothing was added to the top level without being asked for. Not before.

## Anti-slop list

No feature that was not asked for. Propose it instead.

No `TODO`, no stubbed return, no "implementation omitted" comment. If it is not built,
it does not have a file yet.

No `any` and no type assertion used to quiet the compiler. Fix the type.

No empty `catch`, and no `catch` that only logs.

No dependency without one line saying why, asked before it is installed.

Delete replaced code. Do not comment it out.

When a requirement is ambiguous, ask one question. Do not invent an answer.

Durations are integer minutes. No floats, no seconds, no milliseconds in the domain.

Conflicts are returned as data. Never thrown, never silently corrected.

Every word in the product follows `.claude/rules/writing.md`, which is always loaded.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
