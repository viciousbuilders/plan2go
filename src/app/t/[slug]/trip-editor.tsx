          field stays put whatever is under it, and the sheet keeps its own
          top clear for it. That is where a map search sits in the panel it

          over the map alone it is the same field in the same place.

          side, with its lift, since it floats over the map as it does on a
          desk, and its quick searches standing on the map under it. Its list
          opens over everything on the map, the day's rows at its foot
          included, which stay where they are under it. Under every sheet,
