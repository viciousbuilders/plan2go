 * laid on the panel's sunken ground, one under the other, with the room the
 * gutter gives at the top and between them.
 *
 * The first is the trip itself: its name, its dates and what can be done to
 * it, on one pill of raised paper. A pill rather than a band across the top,
 * because it is one row about one thing and a floating control is what this
 * product draws that as; the shadow is the floating control's. Padded to the
 * name's line, which at the title step is thirty, so the row is fifty with
 * the name the tallest thing in it and the controls beside it sized under
 * that. Eighteen in from the left edge to the name and twelve to the button
 * at the right, so the name sits in from the pill's curve and the round
 * button sits in its end. It does not clip, since the calendar and the trip's
 * menu hang out of it over the day.
 *
 * On a phone there is no pill. The name is the page's headline, the dates are
 * a line under it, and the trip's menu, the one round button, stands at the
 * right of the name, the way design 1b heads the page: a grid of the name's
 * column and the button's, with whatever goes under the name placing itself
 * in the second row.

 * it holds to that shape, since a strip scrolled under its ends would
 * otherwise show a cut off day outside the curve.
 *
 * There is no line under the strip naming the open day any more. The tab
 * says which day it is and its date, and when the day leaves is set on the
 * day itself, on the time it leaves at.
