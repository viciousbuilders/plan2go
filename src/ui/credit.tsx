/**
 * Who made this: the line at the foot of the front door and of every printed
 * sheet. One place for it, so the two say it the same way, heart and all.
 *
 * Inline, and sized by whatever it sits in: the heart is as tall as the
 * words beside it and a shade darker than the accent, which is the one
 * step of it that reads as text at these sizes, and the name is a link in
 * the same ink. On paper the link is still the name.
 *
 * Quiet, the heart is the accent itself and the name is a link in whatever
 * ink its line gives it, with no weight or underline of its own: the foot of
 * a sheet, where nothing on the line is louder than the rest of it, and
 * where the sheet draws the name in the heart's ink.
