 * things and should see both answers. On the trip's own name row on a desk it
 * is one control among several on a 34px line: no label and no box. The dates
 * sit beside the trip's name as a fact about it, and a row that reads "Hanoi,
 * five days 10-15 Sept Change" spends its last word on the mechanism rather
 * than on the trip.
 *
 * On a phone it is not on the name's row at all. The dates are written under
 * the name there and set under Edit trip, in the sheet the trip's menu comes
 * up as, where the calendar is the page: open from the start, in the sheet
 * rather than over it, and never put away, under a pill with a calendar on it
 * that reads out the dates and how many days they come to as they are drawn.
 * With nothing to open, the pill is not something to press.
 *
 * No home shows the word that opens it. The word is still there for anybody
 * who cannot see the pill light up under the pointer.
 *
 * The starter page's numbers are those of the fields beside it, from
 * field-styles, rather than the type scale that governs the planner. DESIGN.md
 * says as much: it owns src/app/t, src/features and src/ui, and the marketing
 * page answers to the skill instead.
