 *
 * Every tab as wide as the widest date needs, so the strip reads as a row of
 * days rather than a row of words, however narrow a Monday is beside a
 * Wednesday. A date wider than that still gets its room. 44 tall, the height
 * a finger needs, with the two lines four apart centred in it. Stated rather
 * than left to the lines and their padding, which came to 44.5 and put every
 * tab, and everything under the strip, on half a pixel.
 *
 * A pill inside the strip's pill, eight in from its edge, so the two curves
 * run alongside each other. Positioned, so each day is drawn over the chosen
 * day's pill sliding under them.
 *
 * The ring is drawn outside, the way it is on every other control: inside,
 * it was terracotta on the chosen day's dark pill, and hard to find. The
 * strip keeps the room for it.
 *
 * On a phone a day is a card of its own, the way design 1b of "PlanToGo
 * iPhone app" draws the strip, though without the dot it puts ahead of the
 * number: its number over its date over its city, centred in the card both
 * ways rather than laid from its left edge as the design has them, so a day
 * with no city stands in the middle of a card as tall as its neighbours. On
 * raised paper inside a hairline and rounded at the panel's radius. At least
 * eighty wide, so the strip reads as a row of days, and wider for a city with
 * a longer name.

          above off the space over it, and the strip reaches four out into the

          anyway and the line under them runs exactly as far as they do. The

          days under them rather than cutting them off at the page's gutter,
          with the page's twenty at either end of the row, so the first card
          stands under the trip's name. The cards are six apart, all as tall
